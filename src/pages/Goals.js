      <h1>Goals & Objectives</h1>
      <h3>ESTABLISH AN INTERNATIONAL MINISTRY THAT ENCOURAGES EVANGELISM AND CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP</h3>
      <p>Bring together, under an "umbrella", the many and varied "pockets" of golf mini-ministries that are spread around the world. To unite them in a common bond and common purpose in which to serve our Lord. "The pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel. As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." (Proverbs 27:9, 17). Also, to promote and foster Christian fellowship, fun and common interests among Christians while providing the means and natural opportunities for evangelizing and witnessing for the cause of our Lord Jesus Christ</p>
      <h3>ESTABLISH LOCAL CGA CHAPTERS TO FURTHER THE MINISTRY</h3>
      <p>Promote Christian fellowship on the local level through the formation of local CGA chapters. Local chapters will conduct regular monthly meetings and/or golf outings. The chapter will meet in the clubhouse prior to tee time for a Bible study, devotional and/or prayer session. CGA Headquarters will provide all necessary support and guidance to assist the local chapters in their formation, outreach, evangelism and other on-going activities.</p>
      <h3>PROVIDE EVENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE THE MINISTRY</h3>
      <p>CGA will conduct annual National Golf Tournament and Praise Rally - "The TeeShot Heard 'Round The World." This will provide the opportunity for members from all around the world to come together in fellowship and praise and share with each other. Local CGA Chapters will conduct local and regional golf tournaments, golf clinics, youth tournaments and other activities designed to further the cause of the Association and to provide an environment for good, clean Christian fun on the golf course.</p>
      <h3>PUBLISH QUARTERLY NEWSLETTERS</h3>
      <p>Publish and distribute to all members a quarterly newsletter that contains inspirational and spiritual messages as well as articles regarding the activities of the Association.</p>
      <h3>ENHANCE MEMBER BENEFITS</h3>
      <p>Improve and enhance member benefits as membership in the Association grows. Include such benefits as golf course discounts, golf travel vacation packages, golf retail outlet discounts, hotel discounts and travel discounts, etc.</p>
      <h3>TEE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD</h3>
      <p>This is our single most ambitious under taking of all! That's why we call it a VISION for each year. In the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, there are over 100 golf courses. Our goal (and our plan) is to completely take over 100 golf courses for a single day! Once a year CGA golfers and their guests gather at Myrtle Beach for a PRAISE RALLY & GOLF RETREAT. On a Friday evening, in a clubhouse, you will hear from some of the most inspiring speakers from the Christian community and the PGA Tour. The evening is usually capped off with some of the greatest gospel music and singing you can imagine. Early Saturday morning, on 100 golf courses, on each hole, Christian golfers - 8,000 of them - will be poised to tee-off at the same precise moment. On signal from the weather horn at each golf course you will be able to hear the "swoosh" as each golfer starts his backswing for -- "The Tee-Shot Heard 'Round the World!"</p>
      <h3>REGIONAL GOLF TOURNAMENTS</h3>
      <p>As Local CGA Chapters form and grow, they begin conducting regional golf tournaments for members and their guest. Chapters from throughout the region come together with the host chapter to enjoy a day on the course with fellow Christians and CGA members. These are some of the highlights of our outreach and evangelical objectives. This is an area where every member can participate by helping to recruit members in your geographical area. The host chapter organizes and plans the tournaments. Regional tournaments should rotate among chapters in the region.</p>
